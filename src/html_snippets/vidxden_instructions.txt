Event Reconstruction:

Step 1:
	Download the form in request1.html

Step 2:
	Get the source file: 'challenge.js' from the link in the form
	This will write a script tag into the original HTML. The src is _puzzle.js
	
Step 3:
	Retrieve _puzzle.js from the src tag written by Challenge.
	This script attempts to load several things: _challenge.js, then the captcha at /papi/media?c=.
	
Step4:
	Retrieve _challenge.js, and the captcha. Solve the captcha, and submit.
